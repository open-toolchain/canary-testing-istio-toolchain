template.name: "Develop and canary test a Kubernetes app using Istio"
template.description: "With this toolchain, you can develop, A/B test and deploy an application securely into a Kubernetes cluster managed by the IBM Cloud Container Service. By default, the toolchain uses a sample Node.js \"Hello World\" app, but you can link to your own Git repository instead. This toolchain is preconfigured for continuous delivery with A/B testing, [Vulnerability Advisor](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/va?topic=va-va_index), source control, issue tracking, and online editing.\n\n You can manage your IBM Cloud Container clusters in the [console](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/clusters).\n\nThis toolchain uses tools that are part of the Continuous Delivery service. If an instance of that service isn't already in the selected resource group or organization, when you click **Create**, it is automatically added with the free [Lite](/catalog/services/continuous-delivery/) plan selected.\n\nTo get started, click **Create**.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, follow the [tutorial](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/tutorials/use-canary-testing-in-kubernetes-using-istio-toolchain).\n\nDISCLAIMER: This toolchain uses [Istio](https://istio.io/) 1.1, which requires more resources than available in IKS lite clusters, please ensure you target a standard cluster instead."
template.gettingStarted: " **Your toolchain is ready!**\n**Quick start:** Commit a change in canary branch to the Git repo to start canary testing a new feature in your Kubernetes cluster. For step-by-step instructions, see the [tutorial](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/tutorials/use-canary-testing-in-kubernetes-using-istio-toolchain) for this toolchain.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This toolchain uses [Istio](https://istio.io/) 1.1, which requires more resources than available in IKS lite clusters, please ensure you target a standard cluster instead."
